# 🧠 ClariChain

ClariChain is an AI-powered document understanding and verification platform integrated with the **Cardano blockchain**. It allows users to upload complex documents (e.g. legal contracts, policies, academic papers), receive clear AI-generated explanations, and mint **Proof-of-Understanding NFTs** to serve as tamper-proof, verifiable records.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Upload Complex Documents** (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- **AI Breakdown Engine** (Technical & ELI5 summaries)
- **Encrypted AI Review** for privacy and confidentiality
- **Annotate & Approve Summaries**
- **Invite Co-signers** for multi-party agreement
- **Mint NFT on Cardano** as Proof-of-Understanding
- **Dashboard** to manage uploads, invites, and NFT history

---

## ✨ How It Works

1. **Upload** a document (PDF, DOCX, or Text)
2. **AI Explains** the document in plain English
3. **Edit / Annotate** the explanation as needed
4. **Invite Co-signers** to verify & approve the content
5. **Mint NFT** on Cardano once all parties sign off
6. **Access NFT** securely through supported Cardano wallets

---

## 🔐 What’s Inside the NFT?

- Document hash
- AI-generated + user-edited explanation
- Timestamp of minting
- Signatures of all involved parties

---

## 📊 Success Metrics (KPIs)

- ⚡ 80%+ task completion rate (upload → mint)
- 🧠 1,000+ NFTs minted within 6 months
- 💬 90% user satisfaction on clarity and trust
- 🔐 <5% discrepancy between original and verified docs
